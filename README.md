# CEMFI Course 2024

This is a repository of some simple code to showcase a few methods that we are seeing in class.

The code K_means.R proivdes a laboratory to test the Lloyd's algorithm for different specifications of a location-scale model. 

In the folder "Grouped-Patterns code" you can find a Matlab file that computes the GFE estimator with group-specific coefficients for the application data used in "Grouped Patterns of Heterogeneity", Bonhomme, S. and E. Manresa, Econometrica 2015. The application is based on the paper "Income and Democracy" by Acemoglu, D., S. Johnson, J. A. Robinson and P. Yared., AER 2008.
